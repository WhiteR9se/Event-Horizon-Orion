## In this hackathon project, 

### 1. Fine-Tuning AI models to predict, detect and analyze disasters and their reccurrences.
    We are fine-tuning AI models to the publicly available datasets  
    to predict where and when might a disaster hit, looking at the previous cases.

### 2. Monitoring environmental changes for a sustainable future.
    We are tracking land cover changes and vegetation patterns  
    while detecting deforestation and ecosystem degradation.

### 3. Analysing Geospatial Data and Enhancing the model 
    We are developing data-efficient models requiring minimal labeled data
    and ensuring models generalize across different geographical regions and
    time periods    


## Till Second Deadline:  
    We have tinkered with the AI model given to us.
    We have retrieved the model and tried it on one image. We will be doing this on multiple images and for multiple cases now.
